# About this repository:
This is just a simple implementation of a 2D memory card game using C# and Unity. 

# How to play:
Select two cards that you think will have matching shapes. If they match, you earn a point, but if they don't match, both cards are flipped over. You can keep selecting two cards at a time until all of the matching pairs have been found. Pressing start at any time will reset the game.
